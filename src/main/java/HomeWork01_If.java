        Ask user to enter his weight and height. Calculate body index of the user.

        To calculate body mass index use "bodyMassIdx = weight / squareOfHeigth" formula.
        ** "Your BMI is : " + bodyMassIdx
        ** 1) body mass inx less than 18.5 ==> "You are weak"
        ** 2) bodyMaxInx between 18.5-25  ==> "Your weight is ideal"
        ** 3) bodyMassIndex between 25-30 ==> "You are fat"
        **4)  bodyMassIndex greater than 30 ==> "Obese
